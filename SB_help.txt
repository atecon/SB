This function creates bootstrap pseudo-data resampling a set of zero mean
stationary time series using the Stationary Bootstrap with random block size

American Statistical Association, vol. 89, 1994, pp. 1303-1313.

inputs:
x:   matrix, data to be resampled. Rows: time periods, columns: variables
b:   int, mean block size; if b=0: use rule-of-thumb
b = round(1.75*(T^(1/3)) as in Palm, F.C., S. Smeekes, , J.P. Urbain (2011)

output:
matrix of I(0) bootstrap pseudodata of the same dimensions of the input matrix

Note for the sample script:
Example 1 estimates 95% bootstrap confidence intervals for the cointegrating
coefficients of a relationship estimated on Johansen's danish data supplied as
Gretl example dataset. A rather small number of redrawings is used, in actual
empirical work a much larger number, at least 1000 and up to 5000, is
recommended.
Real money, real income and the bond rate are found to be cointegrated by using
the Engle-Granger test. Hence, the OLS residuals are stationary. However, they
will generally be weakly dependent, so that simple redrawing as carried out by
the Gretl function "resample" cannot be applied, while block bootstrap as
carried out by "resample" with the optional "b" argument would be legitimate. However, the block bootstrap is not guaranteed to produce stationary
pseudo-residuals. This will have serious consequences in this context.
